# yt_dl
A simple youtube-dl music/video downloader

Requires you to have youtube-dl(pip install youtube-dl) and ffmpeg installed.

To use it change the variable outputLocationin YT-DL_MP3.py and YT-DL_MP4.py to the location you want the output files to be saved, 
then simply run YT-DL_MP3.py for mp3 or YT-DL_MP4.py for mp4, then paste your link in the terminal and hit ENTER.

First it will download the .webm file and then, using ffmpeg, converts it to mp3 or mp4.
